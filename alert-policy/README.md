# GCP Alert Policy

An alert policy is a configuration that defines the conditions under which an alert should be triggered and the actions that should be taken when the alert is triggered. Alert policies can be created in the GCP console or via the GCP Monitoring API, and can be based on various types of conditions, including metric-based conditions, log-based conditions, and uptime check conditions. Alert policies can also specify notification channels to send notifications to when an alert is triggered, and can include documentation to provide additional context and information about the alert. Additionally, alert policies can be created in Terraform using the `google_monitoring_alert_policy` resource provided by the Google Cloud provider for Terraform. Terraform allows for alert policies to be created in a consistent and reproducible manner, and can be used to manage alert policies alongside other infrastructure resources.
